      width=Second Florentino Pére presidency amid the outrage over the club
      decline.[84][85] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his
      first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds
      sterling) sum of £56 million,[86] and then breaking the record again by
      purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[87]
      Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the
      assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[88] The 2009–10
      season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in
      the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at
      the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The
      season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for
      seven weeks,[89] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33
      goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102
      goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with
      the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues,
      until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[90][91] José Mourinho
      took over as manager in May 2010.[92][93] In the 2010–11 season, the
      rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a
      brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in
      football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with
      92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the
      Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals,
      where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from
      16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first
      time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The
      first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with
      penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey
      final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first
      trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth
      ones in the controversial[94][95] two-legged Champions League semi-finals
      on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory
      and a 1–1 home draw).[96] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in
      La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season,
      with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the
      2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its
      history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set,
      including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals
      scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins
      overall.[97] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th
      successive season,[98] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a
      penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del
      Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the
      quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became
      the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In
      reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend
      Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club
      mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first
      player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single
      season.[99][100] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the
      Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super
      cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close
      to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga,
      accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions
      League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia
      Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the
      round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat
      Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t.
      Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming
      away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the
      season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in
      the region of £33 million.[101] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del
      Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of
      the season by "mutual agreement".[102]
